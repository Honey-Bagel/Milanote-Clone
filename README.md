# Milanote clone 
### Clone of milanote.com[https://milanote.com/]

## Description
I developed a very similified bare bones version of milanote. 

### Backend
I used Express.js to runmy backend server.
JWT and bcrypt were implemented for authentication as encryption respectively.
I implemented MongoDB as my nosql database to hold information about users, boards, and notes.

### Frontend
I built a React frontend, and made use of axios to send requests to the backend.
I used fabric.js for the canvas and canvas interactions.
Socket.io allowed for real-time interacticty on boards between users.
